Hello, and welcome to my first video! 


Before we dive into the introduction to agents, let me share a quick overview of this channel. 

Weâ€™ll be exploring agents through the lens of large language models and showing how to implement them in Python. 


For each topic, you can expect two videos: 

one that unpacks the theory 

and another that puts those ideas into practice with a hands-on Python script.
