Hello, and welcome to my first video! I want to share a quick overview of this channel. 

We’ll be exploring agents through the lens of large language models and showing how to implement them in Python. 

For each topic, you can expect two videos: 
- One that unpacks the theory 
- and another that puts those ideas into practice with a hands-on Python script.
